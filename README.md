# Checkmate Examples
This repository includes examples for working with Checkmate from Red Pill Analytics. Checkmate enables Continuous Delivery for products or platforms that don't naturally support it.

# Layout
The repository is designed to have a directory for each Checkmate plugin located in the project root (called the *plugin directory*), each containing one or more example projects located in separate directories (called the *project directory*.) Each project directory contains a **quickstart** for using Checkmate with that project.

The current plugin and project directories exist so far:

- [obi](obi): The plugin directory for Checkmate for OBI.
    - [sample-12c](obi/sample-12c): A project directory using OBIEE 12.2.1.2.
    - sample-11g: (Coming Soon) A project directory using OBIEE 11.1.1.9.
