# Checkmate Examples
This repository includes examples for working with Checkmate from Red Pill Analytics. Checkmate enables Continuous Delivery for products or platforms that don't naturally support it.

# Layout
The repository is designed to have a directory for each Checkmate plugin located in the project root (called the *plugin directory*), each containing one or more example projects located in separate directories (called the *project directory*.) A **README.md** with documentation specific to the plugin will be located in the *plugin directory*, with anything project-specific documented in the **README.md** in the *project directory*.

Currently, only the [Checkmate for OBI](http://redpillanalytics.com/checkmate/) plugin directory exists, with the following layout of project directories:

- `sample-12c`: An project directory example for OBIEE 12.2.1.2.
- `sample-11g`: (Coming Soon)
