# Checkmate Examples
This repository includes examples for working with Checkmate from Red Pill Analytics. Checkmate enables Continuous Delivery for products or platforms that don't naturally support it.

# Layout
The repository is designed to have a directory for each Checkmate plugin located in the project root (called the *plugin directory*), each containing one or more example projects located in separate directories (called the *project directory*.) The project directory contains a **README.md** file that contains the Quickstart description and exercises for working with Checkmate.

Currently, we only have a single Quickstart configured: [Checkmate for OBI using OBIEE 12.2.1.2](obi/sample-12c/README.md).
